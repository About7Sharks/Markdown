### What this will be
This will be a collection of thoughts about recent AI progress.

### 2 major advances
Stable diffusers and more data for LLM's. OpenAi recentley released chatGPT which is actually a slightly tweaked version of previous versions OpenAi had released the difference in this case was the inuitive nature of their app. The interface was simple and it gained more users faster than any other app beating the likes of tik tok in how fast it was able to grow. Other than LLM's another expotential area of growth was spured by another one of OpenAi's projects which was dalle and dalle2 which utilizes a type of tech called stable diffusers. Allowing users for the first time to be able generate near graphic designer pieces of art by simply typing a few words.

### Pandoras Box
It is quite apparent the use of some of the tools and ability to improve ones output. I don't think we are going back. I think it will only accelerate and we best strap on and learn to make friends with it. 

## Optimizations
At the time of writing this nvidia's stock is sky rocketing and hitting all time highs driven by the depand for their gpu's to run and train the large datasets these models require. I'm currious as to the future as i'm already seeing crazy optimizations. It will be intresing to see how long gpt4 esque models will take till they are running in webpages.
