### What this will be
This will be a collection of thoughts about recent AI progress.

### 2 major advances
Stable diffusers and more data for LLM's. OpenAi recentley released chatGPT which is actually a slightly tweaked version of previous versions OpenAi had released the difference in this case was the inuitive nature of their app. The interface was simple and it gained more users faster than any other app beating the likes of tik tok in how fast it was able to grow. Other than LLM's another expotential area of growth was spured by another one of OpenAi's projects which was dalle and dalle2 which utilizes a type of tech called stable diffusers. Allowing users for the first time to be able generate near graphic designer pieces of art by simply typing a few words.
