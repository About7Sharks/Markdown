# This blog is awesome

## Welcome

If you've stumbled on this page you may be interested in what makes this website different from others!

## Decentralized and uncensorable

It's being hosted through the power of Cryptography and Decentralized technologies like the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and
[Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/)

## Auto updates

It fetches markdown posts that I host [here](https://github.com/About7Sharks/Markdown) and builds the journal pages based of the content. I found this to be the best CMS system with the least amount of bloat, with maximum configurability.

## Open source

The code for this project can also be found [here](https://github.com/About7Sharks/reactportfolio) if you'd like to poke around and see how I did things!

Did I menton it's made by yours truly ðŸ˜˜
